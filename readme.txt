Our Abandoned Cart Plugin gives you the ability to remind your users of items they left in their carts without having made a purchase. This simple and effective technique brings users back to your website and gives them a refreshed look at your products. With Automation, not only can you remind your users of their abandoned cart but you can also offer them special discounts on certain products on their next visit to your store,( i.e. “Thanks for returning to the site, How about a 5% discount?”). You will also be able to add these users to your Help-center or register them as a ticket in your system

The installation process couldn’t be any easier. Just add the plugin to your store and you’ll be ready to start automating processes. You won’t have to Login or register at all.
